The format of the input file is required in the final project file: The first line is the column name, and the data cannot contain missing values.

6. Provide the command used to produce your sample OUTPUT FILE with flags and arguments specified (e.g. ¡°$ python script_name.py arguments¡±).
The output is a scatter plot image, the default name is output-scatter.png

7. Describe your sample OUTPUT FILE(S). If you are completing a custom final project that does not produce an output file, capture the STDOUT of the command specified above and include it here (e.g. ¡°$ command > sample_stdout.txt¡±).
the width/length for versicolor and virginica is almost the same, but width/length for setosa is low.
